Ruby-programs
=============

These programs are from the second edition of "Learning to Program" by Reed Kennedy

All files that are in the format "CH4.rb" are almost exact replicas of examples in the book.

All files that are in the format "CH4_EX5.2" are original work done in response to problems outlined in the book.

Thank you to Reed Kennedy!
