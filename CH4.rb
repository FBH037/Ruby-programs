#Exercises from chapter 4: Variables and Assigment

#Assigning a variable
# my_string = '...you can say that again...'
# puts my_string
# puts my_string



#Using variables to say stuff
# name = 'Finnegan Hewitt'
# puts 'My name is ' + name + '.'
# puts 'Wow ' + name + 'is a really long name!'



#Re-assigning variables
# composer = 'Mozart'
# puts composer + ' was "da bomb" in his day.'

# composer = 'Beethoven'
# puts 'But I prefer ' + composer + ', personally.'



#Any object can be re-assigned to a variable
# my_own_var = 'just another' + ' string'
# puts my_own_var
# my_own_var = 5 * (1+2)
# puts my_own_var



#Object assigments are static and each one has to be reassigned for it to change
var1 = 8
var2 = var1
puts var1
puts var2
puts''
var1 = 'eight'
puts var1
puts var2
